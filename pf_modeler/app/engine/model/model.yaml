      \ DirEquilRefPatch specifies that the pressure on the specified patch will be\

      \ patch. The choice DirEquilPLinear specifies that the pressure on the specified\
      \ patch will be in hydrostatic equilibrium with pressure given along a piecewise\
      \ line at elevation z = 0. The choice FluxConst defines a constant normal flux\
      \ boundary condition through the domain patch. This flux must be specified in\
      \ units of [L]=[T]. For Richards\u2019 equation, fluxes must be specified as\
      \ a mass flux and given as the above flux multiplied by the density. Thus, this\
      \ choice of input type for a Richards\u2019 equation problem has units of ([L]=[T])([M]=[L]3).\
      \ The choice FluxVolumetric defines a volumetric flux boundary condition through\
      \ the domain patch. The units should be consistent with all other user input\
      \ for the problem. For Richards\u2019 equation fluxes must be specified as a\
      \ mass flux and given as the above flux multiplied by the density. The choice\

      \ a properly distributed .pfb file. Only the values needed for the patch are\
      \ used. The choice FluxFile defines a flux boundary condition that is read form\
      \ a properly distributed .pfb file defined on a grid consistent with the pressure\
      \ field grid. Only the values needed for the patch are used. The choices OverlandFlow\
      \ and OverlandFlowPFB both turn on fully-coupled overland flow routing as described\
      \ in [40] and in \xA7 5.5. The key OverlandFlow corresponds to a Value key with\
      \ a positive or negative value, to indicate uniform fluxes (such as rainfall\
      \ or evapotranspiration) over the entire domain while the key OverlandFlowPFB\
      \ allows a .pfb file to contain grid-based, spatially-variable fluxes. The OverlandKinematic\
      \ and OverlandDiffusive both turn on an kinematic and diffusive wave overland\
      \ flow routing boundary that solve equation 5.18 and do the upwinding internally\
      \ (i.e. assuming that the user provides cell face slopes, as opposed to the\
      \ traditional cell centered slopes). The key SeepageFace simulates a boundary\
      \ that allows flow to exit but keeps the surface pressure at zero. The choice\
      \ ExactSolution specifies that an exact known solution is to be applied as a\
      \ Dirichlet boundary condition on the respective patch. Note that this does\
      \ not change according to any cycle. Instead, time dependence is handled by\

      convergence failure cuts the timestep in half and the solver tries to advance
      the solution with the reduced timestep. The default value is 3. Note that setting
      this value to a value greater than 9 may result in errors in how time cycles
      are calculated. Time is discretized in terms of the base time unit and if the
      solver begins to take very small timesteps smallerthanbasetimeunit1000 the values
      based on time cycles will be change at slightly incorrect times. If the problem
      is failing converge so poorly that a large number of restarts are required,
      consider setting the timestep to a smaller value.

      The Original option calculates the theta-x and theta-y for a cell face as the
      average of the two adjacent cell slopes (i.e. assuming a cell centered slope
      calculation). The Upwind option uses the the theta-x and theta-y of a cell directly
      without averaging (i.e. assuming a face centered slope calculation). The UpwindSine
      is the same as the Upwind option but it also removes the Sine term from 5.8.
      Note the UpwindSine option is for experimental purposes only and should not
      be used in standard simulations. Also note that the choice of upwind orOriginal
      formulation should consistent with the choice of overland flow boundary condition
      if overland flow is being used. The upwind and UpwindSine are consistent with

      key can be either Pressure or Flux. A value of Pressure indicates that the data
      provided for the well is in terms of hydrostatic pressure and ParFlow will ensure
      that the computed pressure field satisfies this condition in the computational
      cells which define the well. A value of Flux indicates that the data provided
      is in terms of volumetric flux rates and ParFlow will ensure that the flux field
      satisfies this condition in the computational cells which define the well.

      This key can be either Vertical or Recirc. The value Vertical indicates that
      this is a single segmented well whose action will be specified by the user.
      The value Recirc indicates that this is a dual segmented, recirculating, well
      with one segment being an extraction well and another being an injection well.
      The extraction well filters out a specified fraction of each contaminant and
      recirculates the remainder to the injection well where the diluted fluid is
      injected back in. The phase saturations at the extraction well are passed without
      modification to the injection well. Note with the recirculating well, several
      input options are not needed as the extraction well will provide these values
      to the injection well.
